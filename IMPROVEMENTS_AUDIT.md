# Code Improvements Audit

This document identifies areas for improvement in the existing codebase and outlines our approach to addressing them.

## HTML Improvements

### Current Issues
1. **Semantic Structure**:
   - Some sections use generic div elements where semantic elements would be more appropriate
   - Nested structure could be improved for better document outline

2. **Accessibility**:
   - ARIA roles and properties need enhancement
   - Keyboard navigation flow needs improvement
   - Focus management in interactive components (modals, Domus map) needs refinement

3. **Document Organization**:
   - Long HTML file without modular structure
   - Header and meta tag optimization needed

### Improvement Approach
1. **Enhanced Semantic Structure**:
   - Replace generic divs with appropriate semantic elements (`<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, etc.)
   - Create proper document outline with heading hierarchy
   - Implement landmark regions for better screen reader navigation

2. **Accessibility Enhancements**:
   - Add missing ARIA attributes and roles
   - Ensure proper focus management in interactive elements
   - Add skip links and improve keyboard navigation
   - Implement proper aria-live regions for dynamic content

3. **Modularization**:
   - Break down HTML into logical partials
   - Create reusable components with consistent structure
   - Implement proper metadata and SEO optimization

## CSS Improvements

### Current Issues
1. **Dark Mode Implementation**:
   - Uses `!important` for overrides which is hard to maintain
   - Redundant selectors and properties
   - Lacks proper transition handling

2. **Selector Optimization**:
   - Some over-specific selectors
   - Redundant/duplicate styles
   - Inconsistent naming conventions

3. **Organization**:
   - Single large CSS file with minimal separation of concerns
   - Variable organization needs improvement
   - Media queries scattered throughout

### Improvement Approach
1. **Dark Mode Refactoring**:
   - Implement CSS custom properties for all themeable values
   - Replace `!important` rules with properly scoped CSS variables
   - Create centralized theme definitions
   - Improve transitions between modes

2. **Selector Optimization**:
   - Simplify complex selectors where possible
   - Use BEM methodology for consistent naming
   - Reduce specificity conflicts
   - Leverage `:is()` and `:where()` for grouped selectors

3. **CSS Architecture**:
   - Implement ITCSS organization with BEM naming
   - Separate concerns into modular files
   - Centralize media queries
   - Create utility classes for common patterns
   - Refactor animations into reusable keyframes

## JavaScript Improvements

### Current Issues
1. **Code Organization**:
   - Single large JS file with multiple concerns
   - Limited modularity
   - Global functions and variables

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Inconsistent error handling across features
   - Some edge cases not properly handled
   - LocalStorage usage without proper fallbacks

3. **DOM Interactions**:
   - Some inefficient DOM queries
   - Event handling could be optimized
   - Animation performance needs improvement

4. **Contact Form**:
   - Uses simulated form submission
   - Lacks proper API integration
   - Limited validation feedback

### Improvement Approach
1. **ES6 Module Structure**:
   - Create modular files with clear responsibilities
   - Use import/export syntax
   - Implement encapsulation for component logic
   - Centralize configuration values

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Add consistent try/catch blocks
   - Implement proper fallbacks for browser API failures
   - Add meaningful error messages and logging
   - Handle edge cases consistently

3. **DOM Optimization**:
   - Cache DOM elements where appropriate
   - Use event delegation for similar elements
   - Implement debounce/throttle for performance-heavy operations
   - Optimize animations with `requestAnimationFrame`

4. **Contact Form Implementation**:
   - Replace simulation with proper async API handling
   - Implement comprehensive form validation
   - Add clear user feedback and error states
   - Create placeholder API endpoint framework

## Performance Improvements

### Current Issues
1. **Asset Loading**:
   - No explicit resource priorities
   - Large images without optimization
   - Font loading affects performance

2. **JavaScript Execution**:
   - Some blocking scripts
   - Heavy operations without deferral
   - Animation jank in some components

3. **Rendering Performance**:
   - Layout thrashing in some animations
   - Sub-optimal paint operations
   - Heavy transforms and effects

### Improvement Approach
1. **Asset Optimization**:
   - Implement resource hints (preload, prefetch)
   - Optimize and compress images
   - Implement proper font loading strategies
   - Lazy load off-screen assets

2. **JavaScript Performance**:
   - Defer non-critical JavaScript
   - Use code splitting for feature modules
   - Optimize heavy computations
   - Implement proper rendering loop with RAF

3. **Rendering Optimizations**:
   - Optimize CSS selectors for performance
   - Use transform/opacity for animations
   - Implement will-change property judiciously
   - Reduce paint area in animations
